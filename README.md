## Instruction 

To compile the code you have to do **g++** _exemple.cpp_ -o _nameExemple_

after that it will produce an executable in the same **dir** which we can run by doing 


./_nameExemple_


`Programs written in assembly languages tend to be very fast, and assembly is still used today when speed is critical.`

 `A Compiler is a program that reads source code and produces a stand-alone executable program that can then be run. `

 `A programming language gets compiled (You get a program that is not understandable to humans (unless they learned how to read it)). A scripting language gets evaluated at run-time.`
`There are however interpreters for programming languages and compilers for scripting languages. This is just a rule of thumb that gets it right most of the time.`

## What is C++ good at?

> C++ excels in situations where high performance and precise control over memory and other resources is needed. Here are a few common types of applications that most likely would be written in C++:
> * Video games
> * Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etcâ€¦)
> * High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequency trading)
> * Graphical applications and simulations
> * Productivity / office applications
> * Embedded software
> * Audio and video processing
 


## Path of solving a problem

![Solve](https://www.learncpp.com/images/CppTutorial/Chapter0/Development-min.png)

Typically, good solutions have the following characteristics:

*    They are straightforward (not overly complicated or confusing).
*    They are well documented (especially around any assumptions being made or limitations).
*    They are built modularly, so parts can be reused or changed later without impacting other parts of the program.
*    They are robust, and can recover or give useful error messages when something unexpected happens.
