## Instruction 

To compile the code you have to do **g++** _exemple.cpp_ -o _nameExemple_

after that it will produce an executable in the same **dir** which we can run by doing 


./_nameExemple_


`Programs written in assembly languages tend to be very fast, and assembly is still used today when speed is critical.`

 `A Compiler is a program that reads source code and produces a stand-alone executable program that can then be run. `

 `A programming language gets compiled (You get a program that is not understandable to humans (unless they learned how to read it)). A scripting language gets evaluated at run-time.`
`There are however interpreters for programming languages and compilers for scripting languages. This is just a rule of thumb that gets it right most of the time.`

## What is C++ good at?

> C++ excels in situations where high performance and precise control over memory and other resources is needed. Here are a few common types of applications that most likely would be written in C++:
> * Video games
> * Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etc…)
> * High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequency trading)
> * Graphical applications and simulations
> * Productivity / office applications
> * Embedded software
> * Audio and video processing
 


## Path of solving a problem

![Solve](https://www.learncpp.com/images/CppTutorial/Chapter0/Development-min.png)

Typically, good solutions have the following characteristics:

*    They are straightforward (not overly complicated or confusing).
*    They are well documented (especially around any assumptions being made or limitations).
*    They are built modularly, so parts can be reused or changed later without impacting other parts of the program.
*    They are robust, and can recover or give useful error messages when something unexpected happens.
## There are many different kinds of statements in C++:

>    Declaration statements
> 
>    Jump statements
> 
>    Expression statements
> 
>    Compound statements
> 
>    Selection statements (conditionals)
> 
>    Iteration statements (loops)
> 
>    Try blocks

> `Every C++ program must have a special function named main (all lower case letters). When the program is run, execution starts with the first statement inside of function main and then continues sequentially.`

> `   std::cin and std::cout always go on the left-hand side of the statement.`

> `    std::cout is used to output a value (cout = character output)`

> `    std::cin is used to get an input value (cin = character input)`

> `    << is used with std::cout, and shows the direction that data is moving (if std::cout represents the console, the output data is moving from the variable to the console). std::cout << 4 moves the value of 4 to the console`

> `   >> is used with std::cin, and shows the direction that data is moving (if std::cin represents the keyboard, the input data is moving from the keyboard to the variable). std::cin >> x moves the value the user entered from the keyboard into x`

### What is a statement?

` A statement is an instruction in a computer program that tells the computer to perform an action. `

### What is a function?

`A function is a collection of statements that executes sequentially. `

### What is the name of the function that all program must have?

`main`

### When a program is run, where does execution start?

`Execution starts with the first statement inside the main function. `

### What symbol are statements in C++ often ended with?

`The semicolon (;)`

### What is a syntax error?

`A syntax error is a compiler error that occurs at compile-time when your program violates the grammar rules of the C++ language. `

### What is the C++ Standard Library?

`A library file is a collection of precompiled code that has been “packaged up” for reuse in other programs. The C++ Standard Library is a library that ships with C++ that contains additional functionality to use in your programs. `

### What is data?

`Data is any sequence of symbols (numbers, letters, etc…) that can be interpreted to mean something. `

### What is a value?

`A value is a single piece of data stored in memory. `

### What is a variable?

`A variable is a named region of memory. `

### What is an identifier?

`An identifier is the name that a variable is accessed by. `

### What is a type?

`A type tells the program how to interpret a value in memory. `

### What is an integer?

`An integer is a number that can be written without a fractional component. `

### What is the difference between initialization and assignment?

`Initialization gives a variable a value at the point when it is created. Assignment gives a variable a value at some point after it is created. `
